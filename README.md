# React + Flask Application

This is an application which contains a connected flask backend to a react frontend

## Backend
Step1: Enter the backend directory and create and activate your environment:

For mac/unix users: 

**create:** ```python3 -m venv env```

**activate:** `source env/bin/activate`

For windows users: 

**create:** `py -m venv env`

**activate:** `.\env\Scripts\activate`


Step2: Then install the requirements using:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Available Scripts

Return to the base directory and run: `npm install` before running the scripts below.

Then, run `npm run start-backend` to start the flask backend server.

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

Next, run `npm start` to start the frontend section of the application.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Testing the application
Click on the button that appears on the page to make the request to the API endpoint in the backend. 

## Docker

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image

# Docker Compose 

[
![Docker Compose](https://jeddict.github.io/tutorial/Docker/COMPOSE.png "Docker Compose Logo")


Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker
defined using the [Compose file format](https://compose-spec.io).
A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up
your application are configured.
Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a
single command: `docker compose up`.


# Where to get Docker Compose

### Windows and macOS

Docker Compose is included in
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
for Windows and macOS.

### Linux

You can download Docker Compose binaries from the
[release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) on this repository.

Rename the relevant binary for your OS to `docker-compose` and copy it to `$HOME/.docker/cli-plugins`

Or copy it into one of these folders to install it system-wide:

* `/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/local/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`
* `/usr/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`

(might require making the downloaded file executable with `chmod +x`)


Quick Start
-----------

Using Docker Compose is a three-step process:
1. Define your app's environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so
   they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run `docker compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire
   app.

A Compose file looks like this:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
  redis:
    image: redis
```
